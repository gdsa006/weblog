                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>The not for profit National Association of Debt and Credit Advocates (NADACA®) uses its expertise in consumer law such as the FCRA, FDCPA, and TCPA to work for consumer justice and economic security for all Americans.</p>
                        <p>Nearly all families who find themselves behind on their bills face a financial catastrophe. Recognizing this, federal and state laws require that financially distressed consumers cannot be deceived and treated unfairly.</p>
                        <p>Before NADACA, debtors had no sound alternative but to act alone when dealing with creditors, debt collectors,judges, and navigating complex and changing law. The absence of a national advocacy organization resulted in increasingly successful efforts by predatory collectors’ exploitative practices, harming financially stressed families. Alarmed by these developments, a determined group of experienced professionals decided that an organized approach was necessary to counter these attacks and provide a “fresh start” for those in need.</p>
                        <p>NADACA’s expertise includes education and advocacy; consumer law and self-help publications; referrals to qualified legal experts, expert witness services, and training and support for member advocates. NADACA works with nonprofit and legal services organizations, private attorneys, policymakers, and federal and state government and courts across the nation to stop exploitative practices.</p>
                        <p>NADACA assists financially stressed families to retain and build wealth as our end goal is to advance prosperity for all Americans</p>
                        <p>NADACA’S provides effective and up to date resources to help consumers understand their rights or find a qualified member advocate who does.</p>

                        <p>If you don’t know how to solve your problem, the very last place you should go looking for answers is online or asking commissioned salespersons what they think is best. As a consumer looking for help with your financial challenges getting educated before you do anything is the first step.</p>
                        <p>You need to know the optimal way to resolve your specific financial situation. As a consumer under stress it is hard to develop the correct knowledge quickly. At this point, what happens all too often, is thatmanyfall victim to “so called” debt settlement companies to find a way out. Nearly everyone from settlement companies to counselors sell you their “solution,” as the best you can do. They rarely spend the time truly analyzing what YOU really need.</p>
